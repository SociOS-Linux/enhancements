# Enhancements Tracking for CoreOS-based Systems

Inspired by [openshift/enhancements](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/)
and [rust-lang/rfcs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/) and others.

This repo serves a location to record design decisions that affect systems like
Fedora CoreOS and RHEL CoreOS.  This is also the location where discussion can
happen on those design decisions.
